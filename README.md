# Overview

CS Fixer is an open-source Chrome extension intended to fix some of the incompatibilities in API Healthcare's contingent workforce management solution, Contingent Staffing. The extension itself is available in the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/contingentstaffing-fixer/afphbnhbolodjfimkbdhanhichlabfng).

## Fixes:
* Clicking of entries on Temp History page, including Employment History entries, Education History entries, and entries in the Professional References now takes you to the entry-specific page. The links were nonfunctional.
* Rendering of LT Submission Wizard and Tab switching, allowing creation of profiles.
* Professional Reference page, clicking the row corresponding to the previously-completed reference check for the reference specified now takes you to the relevant reference check. The links were nonfunctional.

## Future Developments:
* Managing Specialties, clicking 'edit' on a specialty does not produce any results.
