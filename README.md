## Fixes:
* Clicking of entries on Temp History page, including Employment History entries, Education History entries, and entries in the Professional References now take you to the entry-specific page. The links were nonfunctional.

## Future Developments:
* LT Submission Wizard, multiple issues.
* Professional Reference page, clicking the row corresponding to the previously-completed reference for the reference specified does not produce any results.
* Managing Specialties, clicking 'edit' on a specialty does not produce any results.
